### Rulebooks

Still YAML, like playbooks


## The flow is 
Sources -> Rules  -> Actions

GA release of Ansible lightspeed is in Octover



##  Misc notes

Podman desktop 1.0 is now avaialble for all

Backstage is something to look into, it's an open source project

RedHat developer hub is a Backstage implementation
It gives a unified view, applicaiton centric, as a starting poing

ROSA is RedHat Open Shift on AWS

The labs were pretty good, but not available now.
